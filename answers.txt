Once you have successfully run a simulation, use your python skills to analyze the simulation results:

1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
The inputs of the simulation were the given ones in the starter code, 
`     virus = Virus(virus_name, repro_num, mortality_rate)
    sim = Simulation(virus, pop_size, vacc_percentage, initial_infected) `

2. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
Before the virus burnt our, the population of infected was around 80%: 800 total infections in a population of 1000.

3. What percentage of the population died from the virus?
The percentage dead to the population was 23.5%.

4. Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
The total amount of vaccinated was 565, which means 565 people were saved from the virus due to the vaccine. The vaccine has saved people from being potentially infected because
vaccines are given to people randomly within the population until everyone's cured or everyone's dead, and because no
